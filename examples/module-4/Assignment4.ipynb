To get a pass grade (grade 5), you need to pass items 1-3 below. To receive higher grades, finish items 4 and 5 as well. \n\nThe exercise takes place in a notebook environment where you can chose to use Jupyter or Google Colabs. We recommend you use Google Colabs as it will facilitate remote group-work and makes the assignment less technical. \nHints:\nYou can execute certain linux shell commands by prefixing the command with `!`. You can insert Markdown cells and code cells. The first you can use for documenting and explaining your results the second you can use writing code snippets that execute the tasks required.  \n\nIn this assignment you will implement a Naïve Bayes classifier in Python that will classify emails into spam and non-spam (“ham”) classes.  Your program should be able to train on a given set of spam and “ham” datasets. \nYou will work with the datasets available at https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/. There are three types of files in this location: \n-\teasy-ham: non-spam messages typically quite easy to differentiate from spam messages. \n-\thard-ham: non-spam messages more difficult to differentiate \n-\tspam: spam messages \n\n**Execute the cell below to download and extract the data into the environment of the notebook -- it will take a few seconds.** If you chose to use Jupyter notebooks you will have to run the commands in the cell below on your local computer, with Windows you can use 7zip (https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to decompress the data.\n\n","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"-sTsDfIVKsmL","cell_id":"00000-48c9186c-11d6-4268-999d-1f11e7a9d320"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"code","id":"Wa37fBwRF-xe","cell_id":"00001-7e23a57e-76cc-42e7-9ae5-d9d1e5a1c2a0"},"source":"#Download and extract data\n!wget https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/20021010_easy_ham.tar.bz2\n!wget https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/20021010_hard_ham.tar.bz2\n!wget https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/20021010_spam.tar.bz2\n!tar -xjf 20021010_easy_ham.tar.bz2\n!tar -xjf 20021010_hard_ham.tar.bz2\n!tar -xjf 20021010_spam.tar.bz2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*The* data is now in the three folders `easy_ham`, `hard_ham`, and `spam`.","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"tdH1XTepLjZ3","cell_id":"00002-90202a8c-5fad-4c68-9f9e-09847c688491"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"code","id":"A53Gw00fBLG2","cell_id":"00003-ae5a4346-e219-4c65-b150-65d35573af14","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"9072a7c1","execution_start":1606723816648,"execution_millis":957},"source":"!ls -lah","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"total 12K\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 jovyan users    3 Nov 30 07:07 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 jovyan users   13 Nov 30 07:06 ..\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 jovyan users 8.8K Nov 30 07:07 Assignment4.ipynb\r\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###1.

The format may vary somewhat between emails, which can make this a bit tricky, so perfect filtering is not required.
